# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Background of problem
PH wants to analyze their employee data to plan for employees who are retiring, new employees that need mentoring, and identify areas for better data gathering and structure to improve their business. For this project, I reviewed data that PH has in multiple files and created a postgres database that makes it easier to query and anayze data.

## Part_1

This involved a review of the fields in each file, determining commonality, and creating a schema that described the relationships between the csv files. (Please refere to
